# Here's all the process you need to follow :--
1) Mix all the items in a bowl and need it.
--> All purpose flour - 2 & 1/2 Cup    (1 Cup = 240ml)
    Powdered sugar - 1/4 Cup
    Baking powder - 3/4 Tsp
    Baking soda - 1/2 Tsp
    Milk - 1/2 Cup
    Vinegar or lemon juice - 2 Tsp
    Salt - A pinch
    Water - 2-3 Tsp (If needed)
2) After needing the dough for 5 minutes add 2 Tbsp butter to it , then need it 
--> The total needing time might be around 10-12 minutes.
3) Then cover the dough and let it rest for atleast 1 hour.
4) After 1 hour again need it for 15-20 seconds.
5) Now roll the dough ,it need to be slightly thick.
6) Cut the donuts shape with the help of 2 different sized caps ,take out the extra dought and you can again use it to make donuts.
7) Now the donuts are ready to be oiled, the oil should be medium hot. 
--> Make sure you dont't fry the donuts at high flame, in that case it will seem to be cooked outside but inside will be raw.
8) Fry until they catch up a light brownish colour.
9) Now it's time to coat them ,if you din't have choclate you can simply coat them with powdered sugar.
10) Melt the chocalate and dip the upper side of donuts into it, you can sprinkle little toppings also on it..
